## Predicting US Election results using Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis refers to identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of topics.

Therefore we need to develop an Automated Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis Model in order to compute the customer perception. Due to the presence of non-useful characters (collectively termed as the noise) along with useful data, it becomes difficult to implement models on them.

In this article, we aim to analyze the sentiment of the tweets provided from the Sentiment140 dataset by developing a machine learning pipeline involving the use of three classifiers (Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and SVM)along with using Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The performance of these classifiers is then evaluated using accuracy and F1 Scores.

From our Project, it is very clear that Joe Biden is getting more Positive tweets and less negative tweets as compared to Donald Trump. So it will not be wrong to conclude that Joe Bined is more prefered by the people to win the US Presidential Elections than Donald Trump.
